# DOCKER-PROJECT
RISE 2020.18.11.3
This project was created under the IIEC-RISE initiative for the docker training by world record holder Mr. Vimal Daga.
I learned many things under this training. Some of them are mentioned bellow:
1. What is Docker.
2. What is meant by container and how to install it in your system.
3. How to pull images from docker hub. For example, I have used Drupal and MySQL images in this project. 
4. Why docker is so fast (it shares some basic features and kernel from the base os).
5. The concept of PAT (Port Address Translation) which I have also used in the project.
6. The concept of environment variables in linux as well as docker images which are used in the MySQL container in the project.
7. Docker-compose is a tool which is used to simplify the process of launching and maintaining containers. YML language is used for writing a code for Docker-Compose.
8.  The concept of volumes which is persistant storage for docker. I have uused one volume for the MySQL database and four volumes for the drupal service.

CONCLUSION: I have learned so many things under this training and even created a project and all this was taught in only six sessions. A lot of appreciation for Vimal Daga sir and the team for such a great initiative.
